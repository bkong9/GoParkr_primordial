[5/12/2017] - Footer, changed some cosmetics.  Added new logo for experimentation, still open to changes.

[5/7/2017] - Added line breaks, reduced size of Google Play & App Store icons, removed bolding from description font, removed excess whitespace between sections.

[5/6/2017] - Removed greyspace around images, now resize based on window size.  App Store & Google Play abnormally large on mobile however.

To do:
- Cosmetic changes (background colour alternation, logo & font change?)
- Add footer once design, ToS, etc. is set up
