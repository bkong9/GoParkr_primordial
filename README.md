[5/6/2017] - Removed greyspace around images, now resize based on window size.  App Store & Google Play abnormally large on mobile however.

To do:
- Add links to App Store & Google Play images (placeholders)
- Fix formatting for mobile
- Cosmetic changes (background colour alternation, logo & font change?)
- Add footer once design, ToS, etc. is set up
